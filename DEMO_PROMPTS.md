# Okteto AI Agent Fleet Demo Prompts

This repository demonstrates the power of the **Okteto AI Agent Fleet** for cloud-native development. Here are 5 compelling demo prompts that showcase different capabilities:

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Prompt #1: Database Migration
**Scenario**: Transform in-memory storage to persistent database

```
"Update my todo list application so that, instead of storing the items in memory, 
they are stored on a database. Use postgres, deploy it as a container, and then 
create a docker compose file so I can deploy everything with one command"
```

**What the Agent Demonstrates**:
- âœ… Automatically integrates PostgreSQL with proper Go driver
- âœ… Updates all CRUD operations to use SQL queries
- âœ… Creates Docker Compose with health checks and dependencies
- âœ… Generates Okteto manifest for Kubernetes deployment
- âœ… Provides live working endpoint with database persistence

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Prompt #2: Microservices Architecture
**Scenario**: Break monolith into microservices

```
"Split this todo application into microservices - create a separate user service 
for authentication, a todo service for CRUD operations, and an API gateway. 
Deploy everything with proper service discovery and load balancing."
```

**What the Agent Demonstrates**:
- âœ… Designs microservices architecture with proper separation of concerns
- âœ… Creates service-to-service communication patterns
- âœ… Implements API gateway with routing and load balancing
- âœ… Sets up service discovery and inter-service networking
- âœ… Deploys complete microservices stack to Kubernetes

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Prompt #3: Observability & Monitoring
**Scenario**: Add production-ready monitoring

```
"Add comprehensive monitoring to this application - include metrics, logging, 
tracing, and health checks. Set up Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting. 
I want to see real-time performance dashboards."
```

**What the Agent Demonstrates**:
- âœ… Integrates Prometheus metrics collection
- âœ… Sets up Grafana dashboards with real-time data
- âœ… Implements distributed tracing with Jaeger
- âœ… Configures structured logging and log aggregation
- âœ… Creates alerting rules and notification channels

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Prompt #4: Security & Compliance
**Scenario**: Implement enterprise security

```
"Secure this application for production use - add JWT authentication, 
RBAC authorization, API rate limiting, input validation, and security scanning. 
Also implement HTTPS, secrets management, and compliance logging."
```

**What the Agent Demonstrates**:
- âœ… Implements JWT-based authentication system
- âœ… Creates role-based access control (RBAC)
- âœ… Adds API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- âœ… Integrates secrets management with Kubernetes secrets
- âœ… Sets up security scanning and vulnerability assessment

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Prompt #5: CI/CD & GitOps
**Scenario**: Automate deployment pipeline

```
"Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for this application with automated testing, 
security scanning, multi-environment deployments, and GitOps. Include staging 
and production environments with proper promotion workflows."
```

**What the Agent Demonstrates**:
- âœ… Creates GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- âœ… Implements automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- âœ… Sets up multi-environment deployments (dev/staging/prod)
- âœ… Configures GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux
- âœ… Implements blue-green or canary deployment strategies
